        size: 'medium',
        popularity: 3,
        temperament: 'Intelligent, Friendly, Reliable, Kind, Trustworthy, Confident',
        about: `The Golden Retriever is a sturdy, muscular dog of medium size, famous for the dense,
        lustrous coat of gold that gives the breed its name. The broad head, with its friendly and
        intelligent eyes, short ears, and straight muzzle, is a breed hallmark. In motion, Goldens
        move with a smooth, powerful gait, and the feathery tail is carried, as breed fanciers say,
        with a “merry action.”
        The most complete records of the development of the Golden Retriever are included in the
        record books that were kept from 1835 until about 1890 by the gamekeepers at the Guisachan
        (pronounced Gooeesicun) estate of Lord Tweedmouth at Inverness-Shire, Scotland. These records
        were released to public notice in Country Life in 1952, when Lord Tweedmouth’s great-nephew,
        the sixth Earl of Ilchester, historian and sportsman, published material that had been left by his ancestor.
        They provided factual confirmation to the stories that had been handed down through generations.`

        size: 'large',
        popularity: 22,
        temperament: 'Good-Natured, Calm, Strong',
        about: `The Bernese Mountain Dog is a large, sturdy worker who can stand over
        27 inches at the shoulder. The thick, silky, and moderately long coat is tricolored:
        jet black, clear white, and rust. The distinctive markings on the coat and face
        are breed hallmarks and, combined with the intelligent gleam in the dark eyes,
        add to the Berner’s aura of majestic nobility. A hardy dog who thrives in cold weather,
        the Berner’s brain and brawn helped him multitask on the farms and pastures of
        Switzerland. Berners get along with the entire family and are particularly gentle
        with children, but they will often become more attached to one lucky human.
        Berners are imposing but not threatening, and they maintain an aloof dignity
        with strangers.`

        size: 'medium',
        popularity: 17,
        temperament: 'Loyal, Fearless, Alert',
        about: `Dobermans are compactly-built dogs—muscular, fast, and powerful—standing
        between 24 to 28 inches at the shoulder. The body is sleek but substantial, and
        is covered with a glistening coat of black, blue, red, or fawn, with rust markings.
        These elegant qualities, combined with a noble, wedge-shaped head and an easy,
        athletic way of moving have earned Dobermans a reputation as royalty in the canine
        kingdom. A well-conditioned Doberman on patrol will deter all but the most foolish
        intruder.`

        popularity: 2,
        temperament: 'Confident, Courageous',
        about: `German Shepherd Dogs can stand as high as 26 inches at the shoulder and,
        when viewed in outline, presents a picture of smooth, graceful curves rather than
        angles. The natural gait is a free-and-easy trot, but they can turn it up a notch
        or two and reach great speeds.`

        size: 'medium',
        popularity: 18,
        temperament: 'Smart, Work-Oriented, Exuberant',
        about: `The Australian Shepherd, the cowboy’s herding dog of choice, is a medium-sized
        worker with a keen, penetrating gaze in the eye. Aussie coats offer different looks,
        including merle (a mottled pattern with contrasting shades of blue or red).
        In all ways, they’re the picture of rugged and agile movers of stock. Aussies exhibit
        an irresistible impulse to herd, anything: birds, dogs, kids. This strong work drive
        can make Aussies too much dog for a sedentary pet owner. Aussies are remarkably intelligent,
        quite capable of hoodwinking an unsuspecting novice owner. In short, this isn’t the
        pet for everyone. But if you’re looking for a brainy, tireless, and trainable partner
        for work or sport, your search might end here.`
